# autotrade
Stock/ETF auto-trading code in R for use with Interactive Brokers' IBAPI

Here is the auto-trading code that I presented at R Finance 2018 in Chicago on June 2. It works with many backtesting platforms 
because it accepts only 2 inputs: 
1) the new, recommended allocation that's generated by your signal, backtest, etc
2) the current allocation (i.e. your current portfolio) that is downloaded via IBAPI

You need 3 things to make Auto-trade work:
1) Interactive Broker's API installed
2) Python 3.6 installed
3) https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync - an amazing Python module

I am a cardiac anesthesiologist; therefore: ANY CODE IMPROVEMENTS TO AUTOTRADE IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

DISCLAIMER: IF YOU USE ANY PART OF THIS AUTO-TRADING CODE IN ITS ORIGINAL OR UPDATED FORM, YOU FULLY AGREE TO ASSUME ALL FINANCIAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE.
